**MEAT**- *meat consumption and the rise in obesity.*


***Motivation***

Growing up in a traditional southern family it was an unspoken rule that all meals had to center around meat. So naturally, that tradition has followed me into adulthood. Unfortunately, so has the "spare tire" around my mid-section... I have always had trouble with my weight. I could lose some, but it would always come back. However, over the past year I have read countless studies and have managed to cut out around 90% of meat from my diet. In doing so I have lost over 60 pounds. I am hopeful that this project will shed some light on the increasing obesity problem and give some motivation to do some research into a healthier lifestyle.

***Executive Summary***

This capstone project is going to look at the real world data to see if there is a possible link between the consumption of meat and the steady rise of obesity. Does the rise or fall of meat consumption match the rise or fall of obesity? Does that trend have a bigger affect women vs men? And does location matter?

***Minimum Viable Product (MVP)***

The analysis for this capstone will be using Python for cleaning, sorting, and making static visualizations. I intend to also use Plotly Chart Studio for more interactive visuals. I will also use PowerBI, Power Query and DAX for interactive dashboards. This will be presented in a Powerpoint presentation that will give the viewer a chance to see the real world numbers but also explore deeper using the interactive features.

***Issues and Challenges***

* I expect the biggest issue to be converting metric weights and measures over to American standard measures in order to merge datasets and link table together in PowerBI.
